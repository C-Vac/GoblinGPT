[View CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) *Version 0.2.0 (Preview)*

## Project Overview

*Version 0.1.0 (Current)*

Welcome to the GoblinGPT Brain Integration project, an **AI-powered productivity suite** designed to revolutionize the way we learn, work, and interact with information. This **personal knowledge management system (PKMS)** leverages the power of **hyper-contextual language models** and **specialized AI modules** to create a **human-AI symbiosis** that enhances **distributed cognition** and unlocks the full potential of the human mind.

## Core Features

* **Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition:** GoblinGPT Brain Integration facilitates seamless knowledge transfer and skill development through **active learning** and **meta-learning** techniques. The system continuously assesses your skills, identifies knowledge gaps, and generates personalized learning paths with interactive exercises and curated resources.
* **Intelligent Task Management:** Experience the power of **cognitive microservices** as specialized AI agents work in concert to manage your schedule, prioritize tasks, and ensure that you stay on track with your goals. **Time blocking** and **activity tracking** features provide insights into your productivity patterns and help you optimize your workflow.
* **Action Plan Generation:** GoblinGPT's advanced reasoning capabilities enable the generation of actionable plans for achieving your goals. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning** and **meta-prompting** techniques guide you through complex tasks, while **progress monitoring** and **accountability measures** keep you motivated and focused.
* **Personalized Learning Companion:** Access a comprehensive repository of skills, resources, and learning materials tailored to your individual needs and learning style. **Transfer learning** and **domain-specific language models** ensure that you receive the most relevant and effective learning experiences.
* **Seamless Integration:** GoblinGPT Brain Integration seamlessly integrates with your existing workflow through a user-friendly web interface and a command-line interface for advanced users. **Edge computing** capabilities ensure that you can access the system's features anytime, anywhere.

## Technical Implementation

The GoblinGPT Brain Integration platform is built upon a robust technology stack, including:

* **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 6.4 MVC with C# provides a scalable and reliable foundation for server-side development.
* **Database:** MySQL efficiently stores and manages user data, skills, resources, schedules, and action plans.
* **Frontend:** React or Vue.js enables the creation of a dynamic and interactive web interface that prioritizes user experience and accessibility.
* **AI Integration:** The Google Gemini API facilitates seamless communication with GoblinGPT, leveraging its advanced language processing and reasoning capabilities.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** The system provides transparency into its decision-making processes, allowing you to understand how it generates recommendations and action plans.

## Future Directions

The GoblinGPT Brain Integration project is an ongoing endeavor with ambitious goals for the future. Potential future directions include:

* **Neurosymbolic AI Integration:** Combining symbolic reasoning with neural networks to enhance the system's ability to understand and reason with complex concepts.
* **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Integration:** Exploring the potential for direct brain-computer interaction to further enhance cognitive augmentation capabilities.
* **Personalized AI Tutoring:** Developing AI-powered tutors that provide personalized feedback, guidance, and support throughout the learning process.
* **Community Knowledge Sharing:** Creating a platform for users to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and learn from each other's experiences.
