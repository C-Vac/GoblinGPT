# Immediate Action Plan

## (!) Goblin Alert: Extra (!) ##

GoblinGPT will assist in streamlining the project, focusing on essential elements and removing extraneous information. The project's goals and reference guide will be refined, and the Project Completion Checklist will be restructured with more granular steps for the current phase.

### Immediate Action: Google Gemini API Integrationâ„¢

GoblinGPT recommends focusing on the Google Gemini API Integration next. This crucial step will enable the application to communicate with GoblinGPT and leverage its powerful language processing and reasoning capabilities.

**Steps:**

1. **Acquire API Keys and Credentials:**
    * Navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console and create a new project.
    * Enable the Google Gemini API for your project.
    * Create API keys and service account credentials for your application.
    * Store the API keys and credentials securely.

2. **Install Gemini API Client Libraries:**
    * Identify the appropriate Gemini API client libraries for C# (e.g., Google.Cloud.AIPlatform.V1).
    * Use NuGet Package Manager to install the required libraries into your ASP.NET Core MVC project.

3. **Implement Authentication:**
    * Use the acquired API keys and credentials to authenticate your application with the Gemini API.
    * Ensure secure storage and handling of sensitive authentication information.

4. **Develop Request Formation Functions:**
    * Create functions to construct API requests based on different Gemini actions (e.g., text generation, question answering, summarization).
    * Ensure proper formatting and adherence to the Gemini API specifications.

5. **Implement Response Handling Mechanisms:**
    * Develop mechanisms to handle API responses, including error checking and status code interpretation.
    * Extract relevant information from the response payloads.

6. **Design Data Mapping Strategies:**
    * Define how the extracted information from API responses will be mapped to your application's data models.
    * Ensure seamless integration with the database and UI.
