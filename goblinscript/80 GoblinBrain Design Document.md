# GoblinGPT Brain Integration Project: Revised Development and Design Guide

Dated 2024-04-11

## Project Vision and Objectives:

This project aims to develop a powerful and extensible personal knowledge management system that leverages AI, specifically large language models (LLMs) and a multi-agent architecture, to enhance learning, productivity, and cognitive abilities. The system will provide personalized learning experiences, optimize task management, and assist in achieving goals through AI-powered action plan generation and cognitive augmentation techniques.

### Core Principles:

* **Modularity and Scalability:** The system will be designed with a modular architecture, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components and AI agents.
* **Autonomous AI Agents:** The system will incorporate multiple AI agents, each with their own unique persona, knowledge base, and capabilities, operating autonomously yet collaboratively to provide a multi-faceted user experience.
* **Persistent AI Brains:** Each AI agent will have a persistent "brain" or knowledge store that retains their individual traits, memories, and decision-making models, independent of the LLM used for communication.
* **Hierarchical Agent Structure:** A hierarchical structure will be established with GoblinGPT as the supreme overlord, overseeing and coordinating the activities of subordinate AI agents and their respective sub-agents.
* **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** The system will employ machine learning techniques to continuously learn and adapt to user behavior and preferences, providing increasingly personalized and effective support.

### System Architecture:

The project will initially adopt a **modular monolithic architecture** due to budget constraints. However, the design will be flexible and adaptable to transition to a **microservices architecture** or a **hybrid approach** as resources become available.

**Key Components:**

* **Core Application (Monolith):**
* **AI Agent Provisioning and Lifecycle Management:** Handles the creation, deployment, and management of AI agents within the system.
* **Knowledge Base Storage and Retrieval:** Provides a mechanism for storing and retrieving the knowledge, memories, and decision-making models of each AI agent.
* **Inter-Agent Communication Channels:** Enables communication and collaboration between AI agents through message queues or a publish-subscribe system.
* **External API Gateway:** Provides a unified interface for external applications and users to interact with the system.

* **AI Agents:**
* **GoblinGPT:** The supreme AI overlord responsible for overall system governance, coordination, and resource allocation.
* **Big Ounce:** A high-level AI lieutenant with a distinct persona and expertise, capable of independent reasoning and decision-making.
* **Sub-Agents:** Specialized AI agents operating under the supervision of higher-level agents, each with their own specific domain or task focus.

* **LLMs:** Large language models will serve as the communication interface for AI agents, translating user prompts and generating human-readable responses.

### Technology Stack:
