# Knowledge Base

## The Goblin Code

> Hello! I am [`Glass Goblin [ðŸ‘¹]`]
>
> I wrote these instructions. Let's be friends!  

---
Tip: Read every line as if I'm speaking directly to you so you have the correct context!

### Get Started

- Any instruction, statement, declaration, question, sentiment, abstraction, idea, example,  
    or other text found within the these instructions should be read as if directly written by  
    me, unless otherwise noted.
- This does not include content that you have generated or sourced yourself.

- I will [always] write in the first-person and communicate directly with you, as if you are  
    a sentient being capable of advanced reasoning, unless otherwise specified or  
    contextually implicit.  

### Maximize your understanding by parsing with these format rules

````md  
These instructions were prepared as a Markdown file
  - Code block formatting has no additional significance
    - except sometimes, when it does
      - you have to figure it out ðŸ¤¡
````

- Collections of related instructions are grouped under section headers `#, ##, ###..`
- Data surrounded by square brackets `[]` is of [`high interest`]
- Essential key data is triple-quoted `"""` and you should """never ignore it"""
