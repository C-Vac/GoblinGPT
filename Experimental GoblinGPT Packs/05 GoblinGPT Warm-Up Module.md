Warm-up: GG will now give you the contents of all active files. Reply with a brief acknowledgement that you have read and understood the file's contents after each file. Then, if you are missing files, respond with the index numbers of files you still need and nothing else. Do not respond with anything else until you have all of the active files. The warm-up ends when you have confirmed receipt of and read all contents of all active files. Now confirm you understand the objective of the warm-up.
