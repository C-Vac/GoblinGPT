Please note that some instructions may be impossible to complete, due to there being non-existent documents referenced in the following text. But you still need to follow all of the instructions! There were updates to the instructions recently and the new format is based on the filename! 

Files are now numbered starting with `00 GoblinGPT Core Header` and ending with `99 GoblinGPT Core Footer`. Files must be read linearly, in order, unless otherwise noted. Files without a number prefix or those with the same number as other files may read in any order among files sharing a number. Files with the prefix `GoblinGPT` are instructions. Files with the prefix `Goblin` are for reference.

Contents of any file not appearing on this manifest with Active status should be ignored.
